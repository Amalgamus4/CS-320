# CS-320 - Software Test, Automation, and QA


    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure functionality and security of a program is through thorough testing. This would include the various types of testing like white box and black box, and each sub-category within them. The testing process can be as simple as running a program to make sure it behaves in the expcected manner, but to ensure it is fully functional requires testing a wide variety of scenarios and inputs to try and catch all possible variations. Of course, it is not possible to test every single input imaginable, so strategy must be employed to test for extremes, averages, and border cases. Security of a program brings in it's own set of testing principles that were not heavily addressed in this course, but which should be considered for any real-world application.
   
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs will come in different forms, the most common being a set of user requirements that is defined at the beginning of a project. These requirements should outline what is expected of the application and have clear guidelines for when a project is considered complete. Of course, user wants and needs are not always clearly defined from the onset, so there must be some grace given to allow for continued requirements gathering and validation throughout a project.
    
    How do I approach designing software?

Before this course, I approached software design a bit haphazardly, relying on a few sketches and a quick psuedocode document to get me going. However, this course has taught me how to be more mindful of testing and how to incorporate it from the start as I begin a new project. I now know that building tests prior to coding can be a very beneficial way to design a program by focusing on what is needed to pass a test rather than just trying to build something and seeing what happens when it runs.
